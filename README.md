## Getting Started

To use this template and set up your project, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Use this template" button or manually clone the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Young-Gaius/Todo
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd webpack-linters-template
   ```
4. Install the dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the development server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will compile the project and launch the development server.
6. Begin coding your project, writing JavaScript and CSS code in the `src` directory.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the project:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint and Stylelint to check for linting issues.
- `npm test`: Runs the project's tests (if any).
- `npm run deploy`: Deploys the project to GitHub Pages.

## Configuration

The project includes default configurations for ESLint and Stylelint, located in the root directory:

- `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint configuration file with recommended settings.
- `.stylelintrc.json`: Stylelint configuration file with recommended settings.

You can modify these configuration files according to your project's requirements.

## Pre-commit Hooks

The project is configured to run the linters automatically before committing changes, ensuring that code quality and style standards are maintained. If any issues are found, the commit will be blocked until the issues are resolved.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

To deploy your project to GitHub Pages, use the following script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This script will use `gh-pages` to deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository. Make sure to set up GitHub Pages for your repository before running this command.
